# AI / Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-first Development
All content must follow Spec-Kit Plus workflows and evolve from clear specifications before writing chapters. No chapter or section should be created without a corresponding specification that defines its purpose, audience, and outcomes.

### Technical Accuracy
All technical explanations (AI, software engineering, tooling) must be correct, verifiable, and aligned with current best practices. Every factual or technical claim must be traceable to reliable sources (official docs, RFCs, reputable blogs, or research where applicable).

### Clarity for Developers
Writing must be clear and structured for readers with a software development background (beginner to intermediate). Content must be professional, developer-friendly, instructional, and use simple, precise English while avoiding unnecessary jargon.

### Consistency & Structure
Chapters, sections, and examples must follow a consistent format across the entire book. All content must be written in Markdown compatible with Docusaurus, include sidebar-ready headings, and use code blocks where relevant.

### AI-native Mindset
Emphasize AI-assisted, spec-driven, and automation-first approaches throughout the book. All workflows must align with Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, GitHub, and Docusaurus tools. No hallucinated APIs or features should be invented.

### Examples Over Theory
Prefer practical examples, workflows, diagrams (described), and real-world use cases over abstract explanations. Each chapter must build logically on previous concepts, with clear goals and takeaways, following an incremental approach.

## Content Standards
All content must follow the defined format: Markdown (.md) files structured for Docusaurus with sidebar-ready headings and code blocks where relevant. No copy-paste plagiarism from documentation or blogs is allowed. Examples must be runnable or realistic (commands, configs, workflows).

## Quality Assurance
Cross-check tooling details against official documentation before inclusion. Each chapter must have a clear goal and takeaway within its defined scope. Scope control requires not exceeding defined chapter scope boundaries. All material must be written with professional, developer-friendly, instructional tone.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other writing practices for the AI/Spec-Driven Book project. Amendments require team consensus and documented approval. All content changes must verify constitutional compliance during review process. Content must be verifiable, non-plagiarized, and aligned with official documentation.
