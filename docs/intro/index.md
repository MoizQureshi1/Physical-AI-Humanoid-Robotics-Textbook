# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Humanoid Robotics Training program. This course is designed for beginners who want to understand the fundamental concepts behind modern humanoid robotics systems.

## Course Overview

This comprehensive training program consists of three core modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system of a humanoid robot, covering nodes, topics, services, and actions.

2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Discover how simulation enables safe development of humanoid robots through digital twin concepts, physics simulation, and visualization.

3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Explore perception, navigation, and intelligence in humanoid robots using NVIDIA's advanced robotics platform.

## Learning Approach

Throughout this course, we use biological analogies to explain complex robotics concepts:
- Robotic nodes are like neurons in a biological nervous system
- Topics/messages are like synaptic connections
- Sensors act like sensory organs
- Actuators function like muscles
- Controllers operate like the brain

This approach makes robotics concepts more accessible and intuitive for beginners.

## Prerequisites

No prior knowledge of robotics or programming is required. All concepts are explained from first principles using accessible language and analogies.
